## Development setup

> Assumes Python version `3.10^`

1. Install [`Poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/) for Python package management. The following should work for Linux, macOS and Windows (WSL):
```
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```
2. Install project dependencies
```
poetry install
```
3. Enter Poetry virtual environment (venv)
```
poetry shell
```
> if the above command returns `Virtual environment already activated`, use the following instead
>```
>source $(poetry env info --path)/bin/activate
>```
4. Install [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks
```
pre-commit install
```

### Environment variables
A template `base.env` file is included inside `/maraudersmap`, which can be copied to a local, gitignored `.env` file. These values are only used for local development (e.g. a local database connection string).

### Poetry integration with VS Code
If you're using VS Code, you need to tell it where your Poetry virtualenv is located
1. `Open Workspace Settings (JSON)` via the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`). This will open `.vscode/settings.json`.
2. Add the following settings
```json
{
    "python.pythonPath": "<Poetry Virtualenv Path>",
    "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "<Poetry Virtualenv Executable>"
}
```
where `<Poetry Virtualenv Path>` and `<Poetry Virtualenv Executable>` need to be replaced with your Poetry env values. These can be found with the following command
```
poetry env info
```
This will display something like
```
...

Virtualenv
Python:         3.10.4
Implementation: CPython
Path:           /home/mathias/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/maraudersmap-ljAqK4qE-py3.10
Executable:     /home/mathias/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/maraudersmap-ljAqK4qE-py3.10/bin/python
Valid:          True

...
```

3. Back in your Workspace Settings, replace `<Poetry Virtualenv Path>` with the value of `Path` and `<Poetry Virtualenv Executable>` with the value of `Executable`. For the above example, it will look like this
```json
{
    "python.pythonPath": "/home/mathias/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/maraudersmap-ljAqK4qE-py3.10",
    "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "/home/mathias/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/maraudersmap-ljAqK4qE-py3.10/bin/python"
}
```

## Run backend
> make sure to [apply any new database migrations](#apply-migrations)
```bash
uvicorn maraudersmap.main:app --reload
```
> omit `--reload` to disable *auto-reload*

## Database Migrations

Any changes to the database schema need to be documented in an Alembic migration file (`maraudersmap/alembic/versions`), which is used to upgrade tables in currently running databases. 

### Create migrations
These migration files can be autogenerated with the following command (inside `maraudersmap/`)
```
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "<Some descriptive title>"
```

### Apply migrations
A database can be upgraded to the latest version with the following command (inside `maraudersmap/`)
```
alembic upgrade head
```
